Web Annotator
=========

Create annotations on web pages.


## Todo

* Allow also free-hand drawing with some special key, 
	but not as default (store as series of points).
* Resize handling (Try scaling? does not 
	always make that much sense)
	* Allow some kind of default behaviors (clear, 
		fixed/locked, try-scale (scale positions, 
		not font or note-graphics) 
* Also handle events that change the position of the annotated 
	element (easy if the size does not change).
* More intuitive note-support
* Read-only mode
