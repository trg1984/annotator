Web Annotator
=========

Create annotations on web pages.


## Todo

* Allow also free-hand drawing with some special key, but not as default (store as series of points).
* Resize handling (Try scaling? does not always make that much sense)
* Allow some kind of default behaviors (clear, fixed/locked, try-scale (scale positions, not font or note-graphics) 
* Also handle events that change the position of the element (easy if the size does not change).
* Ensure that $ and undefined are what is expected inside the closure.
